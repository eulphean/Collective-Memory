# Collective Memory
For [Ziv Zeev Cohen's](https://www.zivzeevcohen.com/collective-memory) solo show [Remanence//Remnants](https://www.062official.com/pastexhibitions/remanenceremnants) in 2019, Amay Kataria developed custom software for the project [Collective Memory](https://www.zivzeevcohen.com/collective-memory). For this project, all the words from an ancient book on Jewish mysticism called Book of Creations were translated using a custom algorithm into machine tokens. These tokens were fed into an arduino, which was connected to 17 damaged hard drives and were distributed across them to create a rhtyhm of harddrive ticks and sounds. This sonified the Book of Creations through the medium of this kinetic installation. 

The Book of Creations was parsed using an open-source creative coding tool called [Open-Frameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/).
